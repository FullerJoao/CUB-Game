THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE GAME, made by me! 

CUB is a game that shows the danger of going for a quick walk in the woods in a world that everything is box shaped, 
and gets invaded by triangles scary ALIENS... well yea that sounds cliche but dont overthink about this original
idea.
this game is a mix of Mario, MeatBoy and MineCraft as everything is squared here and is a run and jump game with 2D graphics...

work in progress.
